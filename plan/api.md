# meedee API contract and representation prototype

Slice 1, 2026-10-13. This document records the approved API choices and the
device-free prototype. It does not claim that these classes are available in
the installed package yet. Production integration and backend replacement are
slice 2; complete message codecs are slice 3 and later.

Additional work beyond the prompt

None.

## Approved language contract

Use native frozen PyO3 objects that own validated Rust values. Do not add
Pydantic or implement musical validation separately in Python. Concrete native
classes derive from a nonconstructible `Message` base. Supported concrete types
have no instance dictionary, writable fields, or Python-subclass extension
point. Immutability includes nested payload ownership.

Public definitions belong to these modules, without top-level re-exports:

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `meedee.messages` | `Message` and concrete musical values/commands |
| `meedee.events` | `Event`, `Timestamp`, and clock descriptors |
| `meedee.midi` | Discovery, transport capabilities, clients, connections and transport errors |

Keep `__init__.py` empty. Rust modules mirror responsibilities, using idiomatic
snake_case functions and typed structs. The current transport API remains in
place during this slice and may be replaced in slice 2 without aliases.

The current maturin build produces one `meedee.midi` extension whose import
starts cleanup workers. Slice 1 therefore registers prototype classes only in
the Rust test executable. Slice 2 must provide separately importable public
modules from the shared core without initializing MIDI for pure value use.
Do not ship a Python module that merely imports the current transport extension
as a shortcut. Test the eventual wheel's imports in fresh interpreters.

### Construction, inspection and replacement

Python constructors are keyword-only. Integer fields require built-in `int`
values, rejecting booleans, floats, strings and integer subclasses. Rust uses
appropriately sized integer arguments with checked constructors. Neither
language silently clamps values or accepts invalid states.

Examples of the intended public construction style:

```text
NoteOn(channel=1, note=60, velocity=100)
ProgramChange(channel=1, program=1)
ControlChange(channel=1, controller=7, value=100)
SysEx(data=b'\x7e\x7f\x06\x01')
note.replace(velocity=80)
```

Expose readable fields, constructor signatures, field annotations, `repr`,
same-type value equality and stable hashes for deeply immutable types. Python
class patterns work through `__match_args__`; positional matching does not
permit positional construction. Objects need not satisfy `dataclasses.is_dataclass`.
`replace(**changes)` accepts existing fields only, revalidates through the same
Rust constructor, and returns a new value. Explicit `None` is an invalid value
for required integer fields, not a request to keep the old field. Rust checked
replacement likewise returns a new validated value; immutable fields stay private.

| Condition | Python | Rust core |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wrong argument type, positional construction, unknown field | `TypeError` | Prevented by signatures/types where possible |
| Out-of-range integer, including arbitrarily large Python integers | `ValueError` | Validation error carrying field/range context |
| Invalid SysEx payload byte | `ValueError` | Payload validation error |
| Unsupported buffer shape/format | Buffer/type error at the input boundary | Caller supplies owned bytes |
| Invalid transport capability or native operation | Existing transport error families, refined in slice 2 | Distinct from pure value validation |

Do not freeze transport error representations or codec recovery policies based
on this small prototype. Encoding, decoding, allocation failure and native
failures will retain distinct error contexts at their respective boundaries.

### Numbering and protocol widths

Channels are 1–16 and Program Change numbers are 1–128 in both public APIs.
Codecs convert to 0–15 and 0–127 respectively, and restore public numbers on
decode. CC identifiers and seven-bit CC values remain 0–127. Bank values,
RPN/NRPN identifiers and MTS tuning bank/program fields retain their standard
ranges. These conventions apply to later MIDI 2.0 types too; wider controller
and velocity values retain their protocol widths.

Do not conflate a MIDI 1.0 type with its MIDI 2.0 counterpart. `NoteOn` has
seven-bit velocity; a later `Midi2NoteOn` has its own explicit fields. The
representation prototype intentionally implements only `NoteOn` and `SysEx`.
The next message slice adds the remaining MIDI 1.0 inventory and actual codecs.

### SysEx ownership

The prototype stores an owned Rust byte payload, excluding F0/F7 framing, and
requires every byte to be seven-bit. It accepts one-dimensional contiguous
unsigned-byte buffers, including bytes, bytearray and suitable memoryviews.
Mutable inputs are copied before the constructor returns. The public `data`
property returns immutable Python bytes; its prototype getter makes a copy.
This is measured representation behavior, not a zero-copy guarantee.

The prototype does not interpret manufacturer IDs, enforce a complete vendor
message schema, assemble packets or implement SysEx8. Do not use its generic
payload validation as evidence that an arbitrary payload is a recognized
musical command. Native upstream allocation limits remain an independent audit.

## Event, clock and Rust stream design

Retain the main plan's separate immutable event model: `Event` contains a
message, stream identity and optional timestamp. Absence differs from a zero
timestamp. A timestamp holds exact integer ticks and clock identity; a clock
descriptor carries an exact rational tick unit, origin/mode and known resolution.
Clock identity must distinguish reconnect generations. Equality of musical
messages does not depend on event timestamps.

Define clock descriptor construction and concrete identity allocation alongside
the shared core in slice 2; capture defaults and cross-clock mapping require
the actual backend evidence before live integration. Do not hard-code
microseconds, unsigned time or a shared origin from the previous backend.
No file-format discriminator or persistence layout is frozen in this slice.

Rust uses validated immutable structs implementing the common `Message` trait
and a closed `AnyMessage` enum for heterogeneous streams. Store short messages
inline, avoiding one trait-object allocation per message. Payload-bearing
variants own their storage. The prototype separates Rust validation values
from their PyO3 wrappers so extraction can promote the same constructors into
the interpreter-independent core without reimplementing validation.

## Evidence and measurements

`src/api_prototype.rs` is compiled only for Rust tests. The existing Python
lifecycle harness runs it with the other native unit tests. Its Python fixture
is `test/native/meedee_messages.py`, using standard-library assertions because
an embedded interpreter does not automatically import the development venv's
pytest installation.

Checks cover abstract construction, native inheritance, keyword-only signatures,
annotations, readable fields, equality/hashing, pattern matching, mutation
rejection, unknown replacement fields, invalid types/ranges, large Python
integers, mutable-buffer snapshots and immutable replacement. Rust checks
cover primitive channel/note/velocity limits and seven-bit payload rejection.
No MIDI clients are constructed and no wire codec is implemented.

Run the focused prototype with the selected interpreter:

```sh
PYO3_PYTHON="$PWD/.venv/bin/python" CARGO_HOME="$PWD/target/cargo-home" \
  cargo test --locked api_prototype -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

Observations on macOS arm64, five runs of 10,000 constructions per sample:

| Interpreter/build and metric | Native `NoteOn` | Minimal frozen/slotted stdlib dataclass |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python 3.11.7, debug construction | 1,387 ns/value | 374 ns/value |
| Python 3.11.7, release construction | 181 ns/value | 377 ns/value |
| Python 3.15.0, release construction | 180 ns/value | 461 ns/value |
| Python 3.11.7, `sys.getsizeof` for one object | 24 bytes | 56 bytes |
| Python 3.11.7, peak Python-tracked allocation for a 10,000-value list | 325,648 bytes | 645,864 bytes |
| Python 3.15.0, peak Python-tracked allocation for a 10,000-value list | 325,512 bytes | 645,806 bytes |

The canonical Rust note value occupies 3 bytes; the boxed SysEx payload
descriptor occupies 16 bytes, excluding its allocation. The baseline has no
range validation and is a measurement control, not a second production API.
`tracemalloc` does not measure Rust payload allocations or total resident memory.
Debug and release observations differ substantially; smaller Python allocation
alone is not evidence of faster construction. These observations qualify
the representation, not Pi Zero resource budgets or live callback throughput.
Repeat release/Pi and stream measurements when the real core and target board
are available; do not add timing thresholds to unit tests.

## Remaining implementation gates

- Integrate native public modules without starting transport workers for value use.
- Promote the prototype once into the shared Rust core and binding, removing
  the test-only implementation; retain the behavior checks.
- Add production Event/clock types, complete MIDI 1.0 types and wire fixtures
  in their planned slices rather than publishing placeholder classes.
- Qualify libremidi's C boundary and build before backend replacement.
- Select the exact Pi Zero model/image/ABI before board performance claims.
- Verify MIDI 2.0 group numbering, attribute fields and unsupported/opaque packet
  policy before its API slice; prototype types do not guess these choices.

Normative baselines and acquisition evidence are in [specifications.md](specifications.md).
